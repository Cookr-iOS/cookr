## Overview
### Description
The aim of cookr is to serve as the de-facto social media platform for sharing delicious recipes with the world!
Our users will be able to learn about new cultures by bringing their ideas to the forefront of the dinner table, with the recipes coming right from the palm of their hand.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Food
- **Mobile:** The following app will be primarily developed for the iOS App Store. Although this app has intentions to remain as an iOS app, it has the potential to expand into a cross-platform web application as well.
- **Story:** The story we want our users to experience is simple: Hop on cookr, admire the wonderful recipes available on our app, post their own recipes to share with others, and create someone else's recipe right in the comfort of their own kitchen.
- **Market:** Anyone interested in learning to cook and learn about new cultures can use this app.
- **Habit:** This app is something users should look at in their free time before eating a meal. Perhaps by looking at the recipes posted by others, they will be inspired to bring that individual's food to their own dinner table.
- **Scope:** The scope of our app can be expanded such that it serves as both a recipe app and a health app. Users can opt in to weekly cooking competitions while keeping track of the calories they consume per meal. This app can potentially be connected to other apps like "MyFitnessPal" in order to determine the calories for a given recipe.
